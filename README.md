This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Followed this tutorial: https://css-tricks.com/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-and-firebase/ 

# Installation
1. install dependencies
`npm install`
2. start server
`npm start`

# Styling
For the sake of speedy development, I used Bulma for styling the elements. Please refer to their documentation when styling elements (but you actually shouldn't have to!): https://bulma.io/documentation/. 

The theme can be modified in `App.scss`, where we can add our brand colors, once we have a final design.
