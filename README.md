This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Installation

`npm start`

# Deployment :fire:
1. `npm run build`
2. `firebase login` (if you are doing it for the first time)

# Styling
For the sake of speedy development, I used Bulma for styling the elements. Please refer to their documentation when styling elements (but you actually shouldn't have to!): https://bulma.io/documentation/. 

The theme can be modified in `App.scss`, where we can add our brand colors, once we have a final design.
