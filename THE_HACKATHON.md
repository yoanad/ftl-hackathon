# The Hackthon
Thank you very much to everyone who participated in FTL's first online Hackathon!

# [Winners](#winners)
## First place

### Quatrefoil
Team Quatrefoil (Merle-Sophie Wuelbers, Maria Jose Herrera, Silja Lüthi, Kevin Ren) analysed sentiment in Reddit data around using face masks because of COVID-19 using VADER in Python. Our findings show that sentiment over time has increased marginally and is slightly positive. We hope that our pilot study will compel governments to consider the benefits of sentiment analysis in assessing the efficacy of their communication methods, especially in a context when the result could have greater implications on public health.

Going forward, we’d consider using news headlines by country to understand how mask use is being portrayed by the media, potentially expanding our analysis with qualitative methodology. [Github](https://github.com/MSWulbers/FTL-Hackathon-0520-Team-Quatrefoil).

### Confifi
Team Confifi (Leyla Serbouti, Nadya Serbouti, Rui Calsaverini) focused on financial risk management during Covid-19, using the Yahoo Finance and WHO APIs with Python. Our findings show that increase in Covid-cases positively impacted market anxiety levels, especially while the pandemic surged. We also found that the normal distribution curve of S&P500 daily returns severely flattened during the Covid financial crash, demonstrating an inflated standard deviation of returns. Finally, we ran random walk models and Montecarlo simulations to prove the inefficiency of basic Value at Risk (VaR) models during extreme events such as Covid-19. Our conclusion is that VaR is to be used for risk assessment models with the assumption of normal market conditions, and that other models should be developed to assess risk in extreme market conditions.

## Second place
CrownPride (Dilip Rajkumar, Gopinath Mylapura Anjaneyareddy, Mahalakshmi Sabanayagam, Victoria Perez Mola) took second place with their Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 related tweets and its impact on Equities.

Description: In this project, we perform sentiment score analysis of tweets containing various hashtags related to COVID 19, lockdown announcements and other stock market related labels and analyse its impact on Dow Jones Industrial (DJI) stock index. We also show interactive data visualizations of the covid 19 pandemic spread across the world (eg: GIS Chloropeth plots) and other interesting plots for the twitter data analytics.

## Third place
Huge congratulations to team Baddies in STEM, and first-time hackathon participants (Georgiana Wright, Madeline Estey, Jillian Violano, Katie Henry) for coming in third place! 

Team Baddies in STEM focused our project on finding the best states for post-bachelor degree graduates to live/find work given the conditions that our society is facing due to the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. Factors we considered when determining the best states to live in (conclusions vary by industry) include the following: comparison of unemployment rates before and during the pandemic (and what industries states profit off of), a "recovery score" (takes into account quality of the state's healthcare system and population density), characteristics of each state's workforce prior to the current economic crisis, and salary/cost of living (as most graduates deal with student loans straight out of college). Learn more about our project, the website we created to display our findings, and the conclusions for five different degrees/industries on GitHub! (under user gayleviolano).
